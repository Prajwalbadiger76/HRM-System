DSA Component Explanation: Leave Conflict Detection Algorithm

Purpose:
To prevent employees from applying overlapping leave requests.

Logic:
When an employee submits a new leave request, the system checks existing approved leaves. If any interval overlaps, the leave is rejected.

Algorithm Flow:

Fetch all previously approved leave intervals for the user.

Sort leave intervals by end date.

Use greedy interval scheduling to choose non-conflicting intervals.

If an interval overlaps, conflict detected.

Time Complexity:
Sorting: O(n log n)
Scanning intervals: O(n)
Total complexity: O(n log n)

Therefore, the algorithm efficiently handles large datasets.
